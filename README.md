# Run-Forrest-Open-Source

THIS VERSION IS NOW INFERRIOR TO THE LASTEST RUN FORREST OPEN SOURCE RELEASE, Check it out here: https://github.com/SEFDStuff/Run-Forrest-FULL

However, dispite this version being inferrior, it still may have value for if you want to remove a lot of fluff from the main project. Plus, I think I commented this version a bit better. Either way ENJOY!
